Last time I didn't provide images so here they are. This is new game screen:

It's basically done. This is desktop layout, and I still need to do and TEST Android portrait and landscape layouts on a device. But I think I'll do a separate pass later to check all screens on a phone.

This is galaxy map screen. It's just stars but with the trickiest functionalities: stars at the right position and right size, panning, zooming, panning limits, and images from SDF. There is still some work to do to make star look nice, but I think it is at the point where I just need to tweak parameters. And convert gas giant image from raster to SDF.
