School season has started, as can be seen from my posting rate. On the bright side there is more that has been done in the rewrite.

You can order fleets around now. There are potential destination ETAs when attempting to move a fleet, ETA when you select the destination, and fleet path lines. Path graphic is a placeholder, the exercise was about how to stretch the length while preserving the width. I’ll do the dashed line later in the polishing phase. Usual 3D graphics operations do not handle repeating patterns so I’ll have to roll my own logic. But when I get there it should not be hard to make them animated. I’m not a fan of current (Play Store published) non-uniform dashes length, they look messy. With animation I could do old uniformly sized ones and use animation to depict direction.

# Side panels

Side panels are done too. All of them, the uncolonized system panel, foreign system panel, foreign fleet panel and multiple selection list. I’m still appalled by how much work the own system panel took. There were so many bits and pieces, it took longer than the rest combined. The multiple selection was a bit untrivial one because it has to communicate with multiple sides but it was a fun kind of complication, one that leaves you proud for a simple yet smart solution.

I’ve started some work on combat and bombardment log but then I realized they can’t be tested without a war. I guess I’ll need to make the diplomacy screen next :). Seriously! Baring polish, the game screen is almost finished. The only thing missing is tutorial stuff, so next work is that or one of the screens accessible from the map.
