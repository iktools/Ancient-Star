In this episode of how research and other off map screens are not being worked on, I bring tutorial and 3D animations!

When doing side panels there were a number of places where ported code was left commented out, the code pertaining to tutorial mode. Since the tutorial is mostly about teaching interface it looks funny from a programmer's perspective, a bunch of hooks spread over the weirdest places leading to an octopus called “game mode”. Normally user interface and game logic are separated but, for example, the tutorial really wants to know if you have moved your mouse/finger properly in order to tell if you’ve figured out how to pan the map. That’s needed in only one tutorial step and nowhere else, ever, but that hook has to stay in code forever. It feels improperly structured but with a valid reason, like Picasso’s drawings.

One surprise with tutorial code that would take me eternity to find out otherwise is that I have apparently missed porting the “reports” button and report list side panel. That’s the one with events that are not tied to an individual star, like a summary of how many ships have been built.

# 3D surprise!

And I’ve finally ready to reveal the surprise I’ve been making since the summer:
